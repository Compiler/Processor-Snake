# Processing Snake

<p align = "center">
***This Snake game was made using Java in Processing IDE for a job given to me on Freelancer***

###Purpose
This is a Snakelike game that controls like Snake, but instead of collecting pellets you are dodging them coming from all directions.
The game gets exponentially more difficulty as time goes on.
